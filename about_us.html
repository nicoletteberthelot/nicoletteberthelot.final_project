		<h4>Hi, I'm Nicolette</h4>
		<p class="about"> Here is a picture of me and my friend Helen. I've known her since freshman year of high school. Born and raised in NYC, getting around has always been a challenge for her. Going from Queens to Manhattan can sometimes take her 2-3 hours. We may not realize it as able-bodied people but NYC is actually a horrendous place to get around in a wheelchair. The subways can be very difficult to navigate. Information on elevator status in stations is often out of date on the MTA website and sometimes people have to go from station to station seeking out a working elevator. There has been a lot of attention paid to NYC's lack of accessibility lately, reading materials on this subject can be found<a id="link" href="https://ny.curbed.com/2017/9/21/16315042/nyc-subway-wheelchair-accessible-ada">here</a>and<a id="link" href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/disabled-new-york_us_55a5084ee4b0a47ac15d5334">here.</a></p>
